# HCI Project
The idea of our project is to create an application that manages bookings for hairdressers and beauticians.
## Overview
> Academic Year: 2020-2021

> Project Title: Booking management system for hairdressers and beauticians 

> Students: Giacomo Ravara and Simone Casini

> CFUs: 9

In this project we would like to create a booking management system for hairdressers and beauticians. On the client side, both the possibility of booking an appointment must be guaranteed, but also the possibility of choosing the hairdresser / beautician in a variable list based on geolocation. It will be possible to choose the service directly, already characterized by a duration. Furthermore, compared to the existing systems, the possibility to modify and cancel appointments will be guaranteed.
Customers will also receive a notification on their smartphone
Professionals will be provided with a booking management system, which can always be consulted and modified.
